## Development Phases

### ✅ **Phase 1-3: Core Messaging (COMPLETED)**

**Completed implementations**:
- Push and pull-based message consumption
- Message acknowledgments and recovery
- Quality of Service (QoS) with prefetch limits
- Consumer lifecycle management
- Delivery tracking and flow control

### **Phase 4: Transactions (Current Focus)**

**Goal**: ACID message operations

**Tasks**:

1. Implement transaction state tracking
2. Add transactional publishing
3. Implement commit/rollback logic
4. Add transaction mode per channel

**Files to modify**:

- `internal/core/amqp/tx.go` (create)
- `internal/core/broker/tx.go` (create)
- `internal/core/broker/vhost/transaction.go` (create)

### **Phase 5: Advanced Queue Operations**

**Goal**: Complete queue management

**Tasks**:

1. Implement `QUEUE_UNBIND`
2. Add `QUEUE_PURGE` functionality
3. Enhance `QUEUE_DELETE` with conditional flags

### **Phase 6: Flow Control & Performance**

**Goal**: Channel flow control and optimization

**Tasks**:

1. Implement `CHANNEL_FLOW` and `CHANNEL_FLOW_OK`
2. Add backpressure handling
3. Performance profiling and optimization

## Testing Strategy

### **Compatibility Testing**

- [ ] Test with official RabbitMQ clients
  - [ ] `rabbitmq/amqp091-go` (already working)
  - [ ] RabbitMQ .NET Client
  - [ ] Python `pika` library
  - [ ] Node.js `amqplib`

### **Integration Testing**

- [ ] End-to-end message flow tests
- [ ] Multi-consumer scenarios
- [ ] High-throughput stress testing
- [ ] Failure recovery testing

### **Performance Benchmarks**

- [ ] Message throughput comparison with RabbitMQ
- [ ] Memory usage under load
- [ ] Connection handling capacity

## Contributing

### **Current Priority**

The highest priority is **Phase 4: Transaction Support**. Contributors should focus on:

1. Transaction state management per channel
2. `TX_SELECT`, `TX_COMMIT`, `TX_ROLLBACK` implementation
3. Transactional message publishing and consumption

### **Getting Started**

1. Review `internal/core/amqp/tx.go` for transaction-related types
2. Check `internal/core/broker/tx.go` for transaction handler implementation patterns
3. See `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for architecture patterns
4. Study existing channel state management in `internal/core/broker/vhost/`

### **Code Guidelines**

- Follow existing AMQP frame processing patterns
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Include unit tests for new parsers
- Test with RabbitMQ clients for compatibility
- Ensure transaction state is properly isolated per channel

## Progress Tracking

**Last Updated**: October 28, 2025  
**Current Focus**: Phase 4 - Transaction Support  
**Completed**: All basic class methods (consume, deliver, ack, nack, reject, recover, qos)  
**Next Milestone**: Transaction support (`TX_SELECT`, `TX_COMMIT`, `TX_ROLLBACK`)

For detailed implementation tasks, see GitHub Issues tagged with the respective phase labels.
