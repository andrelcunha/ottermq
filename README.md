**OtterMQ** is a high-performance message broker written in Go, inspired by RabbitMQ. It aims to provide a reliable, scalable, and easy-to-use messaging solution for distributed systems. OtterMQ is being developed with the goal of full compliance with the **AMQP 0.9.1 protocol**, ensuring compatibility with existing tools and workflows. It also features a modern management UI built with **Vue + Quasar**.

OtterMq already supports basic interoperability with RabbitMQ clients, including:
- [.NET RabbitMQ.Client](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-dotnet-client)
- [github.com/rabbitmq/amqp091-go](https://github.com/rabbitmq/amqp091-go)



## üêæ About the Name
The name "OtterMQ" comes from my son's nickname and is a way to honor him. He brings joy and inspiration to my life, and this project is a reflection of that. And, of course, it is also a pun on **RabbitMQ**.

## ‚ú® Features
- AMQP-style Message Queuing
- Exchanges and Bindings
- Persistent Storage (in progress)
- High Availability (planned)
- Management Interface (Vue + Quasar)
- Docker Support via `docker-compose`
- RabbitMQ Client Compatibility (basic)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
### Broker Setup
```sh
git clone https://github.com/andrelcunha/ottermq.git
cd ottermq
make build && make install
```

## UI Setup (Vue + Quasar)
```sh
cd ottermq_ui
npm install
```

## üöÄ Usage
### Development Mode (UI runs separately)
```sh
# Run the broker:
ottermq

# Run the UI
cd ottermq_ui
quasar dev
```
### Integrated Mode (UI served by OtterMq)
1. Build the UI as a SPA:
```sh
quasar build
```
2. Link the built UI to the broker:
```sh
cd ..
ln -s ./ottermq_ui/dist/spa ./ui
```
Alternatively, copy the contents of dist/spa into a folder named ui at the project root (not recommended due to duplication).

3. Run the broker:
```sh
ottermq
```
OtterMq uses:

- Port **5672** for the AMQP broker

- Port **3000** for the management UI
## üê≥ Docker
You can run OtterMq using Docker:
```sh
docker compose up --build
```
This uses the provided `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` for convenience.

## üöß Development Status
OtterMq is under active development. While it follows the AMQP 0.9.1 protocol, several features are still in progress or not yet implemented, including:

- `basic.consume` command

- Message persistence flags

- Advanced routing and delivery guarantees

Basic compatibility with RabbitMQ clients is already functional, and more protocol features are being added incrementally.

## üìö API Documentation
OtterMq provides a built-in Swagger UI for exploring and testing the API.

Access it at: `http://<server-address>/docs`

If you make changes to the API and need to regenerate the documentation, run:
```sh
