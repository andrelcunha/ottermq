**OtterMQ** is a high-performance message broker written in Go, inspired by RabbitMQ. It aims to provide a reliable, scalable, and easy-to-use messaging solution for distributed systems. OtterMQ is being developed with the goal of full compliance with the **AMQP 0.9.1 protocol**, ensuring compatibility with existing tools and workflows. It also features a modern management UI built with **Vue + Quasar**.

OtterMq already supports basic interoperability with RabbitMQ clients, including:
- [.NET RabbitMQ.Client](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-dotnet-client)
- [github.com/rabbitmq/amqp091-go](https://github.com/rabbitmq/amqp091-go)



## üêæ About the Name
The name "OtterMQ" comes from my son's nickname and is a way to honor him. He brings joy and inspiration to my life, and this project is a reflection of that. And, of course, it is also a pun on **RabbitMQ**.

## ‚ú® Features
- AMQP-style Message Queuing
- Exchanges and Bindings
- Pluggable Persistence Layer (JSON files, Memento WAL planned)
- High Availability (planned)
- Management Interface (Vue + Quasar)
- Docker Support via `docker-compose`
- RabbitMQ Client Compatibility (basic)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
```sh
git clone https://github.com/andrelcunha/ottermq.git
cd ottermq
make build-all && make install
```

## üöÄ Usage
### Development Mode (UI runs separately)
```sh
# Run the broker:
make run-dev

# In another terminal, run the UI:
cd ottermq_ui
quasar dev
```

### Production Mode (Integrated UI)
```sh
# Build everything (UI + broker):
make build-all

# Run the integrated server:
make run
```

### Available Commands
```sh
make build           # Build broker only
make build-all       # Build UI and broker (production ready)
make run            # Run broker (with embedded UI if built)
make run-dev        # Run broker in development mode
make test           # Run all tests
make lint           # Run code quality checks
make clean          # Clean all build artifacts
make docs           # Generate API documentation
```
OtterMq uses:

- Port **5672** for the AMQP broker

- Port **3000** for the management UI

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
OtterMQ can be configured using environment variables or a `.env` file. Environment variables take precedence over `.env` file settings, which in turn take precedence over default values.

### Configuration Options
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and customize as needed:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Available configuration options:

| Environment Variable | Default | Description |
|---------------------|---------|-------------|
| `OTTERMQ_BROKER_PORT` | `5672` | AMQP broker port |
| `OTTERMQ_BROKER_HOST` | `` | Broker bind address (empty = all interfaces) |
| `OTTERMQ_USERNAME` | `guest` | Default username for authentication |
| `OTTERMQ_PASSWORD` | `guest` | Default password for authentication |
| `OTTERMQ_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL` | `60` | Heartbeat interval in seconds |
| `OTTERMQ_CHANNEL_MAX` | `2048` | Maximum number of channels |
| `OTTERMQ_FRAME_MAX` | `131072` | Maximum frame size in bytes |
| `OTTERMQ_SSL` | `false` | Enable SSL/TLS |
| `OTTERMQ_QUEUE_BUFFER_SIZE` | `100000` | Queue message buffer size |
| `OTTERMQ_WEB_PORT` | `3000` | Web management UI port |
| `OTTERMQ_JWT_SECRET` | `secret` | JWT secret key for authentication |

### Example Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
OTTERMQ_BROKER_PORT=5672
OTTERMQ_WEB_PORT=8080
OTTERMQ_USERNAME=admin
OTTERMQ_PASSWORD=secure_password
OTTERMQ_QUEUE_BUFFER_SIZE=200000
OTTERMQ_JWT_SECRET=my-secret-key
```

Or use environment variables directly:
```sh
export OTTERMQ_BROKER_PORT=15672
export OTTERMQ_WEB_PORT=8080
ottermq
```

## üê≥ Docker
You can run OtterMq using Docker:
```sh
docker compose up --build
```
This uses the provided `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` for convenience.

## üöß Development Status
OtterMq is under active development. While it follows the AMQP 0.9.1 protocol, several features are still in progress or not yet implemented, including:

- `basic.consume` command for push-based message delivery
- Message acknowledgments and recovery
- Advanced routing and delivery guarantees
- Memento WAL persistence engine (planned)

Basic compatibility with RabbitMQ clients is already functional, and more protocol features are being added incrementally. See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for detailed development plans.

## üìö API Documentation
OtterMq provides a built-in Swagger UI for exploring and testing the API.

Access it at: `http://<server-address>/docs`

If you make changes to the API and need to regenerate the documentation, run:
```sh
make docs
```
This will update the Swagger spec and refresh the documentation served at `/docs`.
