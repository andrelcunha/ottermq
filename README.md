**OtterMQ** is a high-performance message broker written in Go, inspired by RabbitMQ. It aims to provide a reliable, scalable, and easy-to-use messaging solution for distributed systems. OtterMQ is being developed with the goal of full compliance with the **AMQP 0.9.1 protocol**, ensuring compatibility with existing tools and workflows. It also features a modern management UI built with **Vue + Quasar**.

OtterMq already supports basic interoperability with RabbitMQ clients, including:

- [.NET RabbitMQ.Client](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-dotnet-client)
- [github.com/rabbitmq/amqp091-go](https://github.com/rabbitmq/amqp091-go)

## üêæ About the Name

The name "OtterMQ" comes from my son's nickname and is a way to honor him. He brings joy and inspiration to my life, and this project is a reflection of that. And, of course, it is also a pun on **RabbitMQ**.

## ‚ú® Features

- AMQP-style Message Queuing
- Exchanges and Bindings
- Pluggable Persistence Layer (JSON files, Memento WAL planned)
- High Availability (planned)
- Management Interface (Vue + Quasar)
- Docker Support via `docker-compose`
- RabbitMQ Client Compatibility (basic)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ottermq/ottermq.git
cd ottermq
make build-all && make install
```

## üöÄ Usage

### Development Mode (UI runs separately)

```sh
# Run the broker:
make run-dev

# In another terminal, run the UI:
cd ottermq_ui
quasar dev
```

### Production Mode (Integrated UI)

```sh
# Build everything (UI + broker):
make build-all

# Run the integrated server:
make run
```

### Available Commands

```sh
make build           # Build broker only
make build-all       # Build UI and broker (production ready)
make run            # Run broker (with embedded UI if built)
make run-dev        # Run broker in development mode
make test           # Run all tests
make lint           # Run code quality checks
make clean          # Clean all build artifacts
make docs           # Generate API documentation
```

OtterMq uses:

- Port **5672** for the AMQP broker

- Port **3000** for the management UI

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

OtterMQ can be configured using environment variables or a `.env` file. Environment variables take precedence over `.env` file settings, which in turn take precedence over default values.

### Configuration Options

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and customize as needed:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Available configuration options:

| Environment Variable | Default | Description |
|---------------------|---------|-------------|
| `OTTERMQ_BROKER_PORT` | `5672` | AMQP broker port |
| `OTTERMQ_BROKER_HOST` | `` | Broker bind address (empty = all interfaces) |
| `OTTERMQ_USERNAME` | `guest` | Default username for authentication |
| `OTTERMQ_PASSWORD` | `guest` | Default password for authentication |
| `OTTERMQ_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL` | `60` | Heartbeat interval in seconds |
| `OTTERMQ_CHANNEL_MAX` | `2048` | Maximum number of channels |
| `OTTERMQ_FRAME_MAX` | `131072` | Maximum frame size in bytes |
| `OTTERMQ_SSL` | `false` | Enable SSL/TLS |
| `OTTERMQ_QUEUE_BUFFER_SIZE` | `100000` | Queue message buffer size |
| `OTTERMQ_WEB_PORT` | `3000` | Web management UI port |
| `OTTERMQ_JWT_SECRET` | `secret` | JWT secret key for authentication |

### Example Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
OTTERMQ_BROKER_PORT=5672
OTTERMQ_WEB_PORT=8080
OTTERMQ_USERNAME=admin
OTTERMQ_PASSWORD=secure_password
OTTERMQ_QUEUE_BUFFER_SIZE=200000
OTTERMQ_JWT_SECRET=my-secret-key
```

Or use environment variables directly:

```sh
export OTTERMQ_BROKER_PORT=15672
export OTTERMQ_WEB_PORT=8080
ottermq
```

## üê≥ Docker

You can run OtterMq using Docker:

```sh
docker compose up --build
```

This uses the provided `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` for convenience.

## üöß Development Status

OtterMq is under active development. While it follows the AMQP 0.9.1 protocol, several features are still in progress or not yet implemented, including:

- Transaction support (tx class)
- Advanced queue operations (unbind, purge)
- Memento WAL persistence engine (planned)
- Topic exchange routing (direct and fanout work)

**All basic AMQP message operations are now fully implemented**, including:
- Push-based consumption (`basic.consume`/`basic.deliver`)
- Pull-based consumption (`basic.get`)
- Message acknowledgments (`basic.ack`, `basic.nack`, `basic.reject`)
- Quality of Service controls (`basic.qos`)
- Message recovery (`basic.recover`, `basic.recover-async`)

Basic compatibility with RabbitMQ clients is functional and tested. See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for detailed development plans.

## üìö API Documentation

OtterMq provides a built-in Swagger UI for exploring and testing the API.

Access it at: `http://<server-address>/docs`

If you make changes to the API and need to regenerate the documentation, run:

```sh
make docs
```

This will update the Swagger spec and refresh the documentation served at `/docs`.

## üìÑ Project Pages (Status & AMQP Compliance)

We publish a live status site that tracks protocol/class/method support, planned work, and compatibility notes‚Äîsimilar to RabbitMQ‚Äôs specification page.

- URL: [https://ottermq.github.io/ottermq/](https://ottermq.github.io/ottermq/)
- Source location: the site content lives under the `/docs` folder
- Deployment branch: `pages` (GitHub Pages is configured to build from `pages` with `/docs` as the site root)

Notes:

- The GitHub Pages site is separate from the Swagger UI served at `/docs` by the running server. The Pages site documents status and specs; the Swagger UI documents the REST API.
- When adding or changing AMQP features (classes/methods), please also update the Pages content under `/docs` and merge it into the `pages` branch so the site stays current.
